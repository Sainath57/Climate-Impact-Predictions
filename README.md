## Project Overview & Objectives:
The goal of this project is to predict the impact of environmental changes on crop yields. 
Specifically, the aim is to predict the percentage change in crop yields (relative to 
baseline periods) based on various environmental parameters such as temperature, 
precipitation, and CO2 concentration, etc. In doing so, we will identify the most critical 
environmental factors driving changes in crop productivity and explore the relationships 
between these factors and yield projections. By applying machine learning models, 
we seek to gain a deeper understanding of how complex interactions between climate 
variables impact agricultural systems and how these insights can be used to inform 
climate-resilient agricultural practices.

## Instructions to run the models:
### A. Python:

-> Editors like VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter, Colab can be used to run the models.

-> requirements.txt file consists of the required packages for the project

-> Projected_impacts.xlsx is the dataset.

-> ne_110_admin_countries directory is used to display data on a world map.

-> Python file consists of Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Regression models, Neural Network models, Decision Tree Regressor, 
Random Forest Regressor & XGBoost Regressor.

-> Before running the models, verify the dataset file path.

-> Optimizer in Neural Network model takes hours to run.
